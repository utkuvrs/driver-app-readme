# SFT Driver iOS Android

SFT Driver is a comprehensive logistics application designed to streamline delivery operations. It features advanced routing optimization, barcode scanning for efficient package tracking, digital signing for proof of delivery, and various tools to enhance driver productivity and accuracy in the field.

## Installation

To install the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/SFT-Logistics/driver-app.git`
2. Install the dependencies: `flutter pub get`

## Build

To get build files, use the following command:

```dart
/// Get Android build files.
flutter clean && flutter pub get && flutter build apk

/// Get iOS build files.
flutter clean && flutter pub get && flutter build ipa

/// Also feel free to use:

/// Windows
build_apk.bat
/// Mac
build_ipa.sh
build_apk.sh
```

Sometimes, you might get "Unable to process request - PLA Update available" error while trying to get a build for iOS. To fix this, agree to terms & conditions on https://developer.apple.com/account/ .

If you are unable to run and/or build the project, see Stepfront Utilities.

## Features

This project includes the following features:

- Barcode scan
- Camera
- BLoC, Cubit
- Location
- Push notifications
- Chat using signalr socket
- Language support for: English, Danish, Serbian and Swedish.

## Architecture

This project uses the following architecture:

- View -> Screen (Handling the UI elements and what should be shown to the end-user on which state, State Management.)
- Control -> Cubit (Handling the "Endpoint" calls and also setting the states when necessary.)
- Endpoint -> endpoint (Handling the necessary API calls using the API Provider class)
- Since an endpoint can be used in various screens & cubits, for DRY principles, we have separated the endpoint calls from the cubit.
- API Provider -> (Handles GET, POST, PUT, PUTIMAGE calls to the API as well as authentication tokens.)

## Libraries

This project uses the following libraries:

- `dio` for making API requests
- `get_storage` for storing access & refresh tokens.
- `flutter_bloc` for implementing the BLoC pattern
- `onesignal_flutter` for push notifications.
- `signalr_netcore` for support chat.

## Testing

This project includes unit tests. To run the tests, see test/, use the following command:
Front-end unit tests

```dart

## Dart, Flutter Version

SFT was designed Dart 2.18.6 (stable) and Flutter 3.3.10 versions in mind.
At the time of development, Dart 3 wasn't released.
Flutter version was upgraded to 3.7.12 as of 20/04/2023 (EU)
<br>However, SFT Driver is fully compatible with sound null safety and **MUST** stay as such, because Dart 3 doesn't support no sound null safety.

# Semantic Versioning (SemVer)

Semantic Versioning, or SemVer, is a standard for versioning software that helps developers communicate the changes made to their codebase. The standard is described on semver.org, and it follows a `major.minor.patch` format.

## Versioning

The `major` version is incremented when there are breaking changes to the API or functionality of the software.

The `minor` version is incremented when new features are added to the software, but the existing functionality remains unchanged.

The `patch` version is incremented when bug fixes are made to the software, but no new features or functionality are added.

## Pre-release versions

Pre-release versions can be denoted by appending a hyphen and a series of dot-separated identifiers to the version number. For example, `1.0.0-beta.1`.

## Build metadata

Build metadata can be denoted by appending a plus sign and a series of dot-separated identifiers to the version number. For example, `1.0.0+build.1234`.

## Conclusion

By following the standards described on semver.org, developers can communicate the changes made to their software in a clear and concise way. This makes it easier for users of the software to understand the impact of each version and make informed decisions about when to upgrade.
